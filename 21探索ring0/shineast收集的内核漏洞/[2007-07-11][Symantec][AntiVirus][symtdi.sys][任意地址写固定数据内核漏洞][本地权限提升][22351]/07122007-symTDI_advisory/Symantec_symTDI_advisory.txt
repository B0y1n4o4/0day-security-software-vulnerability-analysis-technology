    = FLAW IN SYMANTEC DEVICE DRIVER: LOCAL PRIVILEGE ELEVATION =
    =============================================================
	

The Symantec Norton security product family for Windows is prone to a 
local privilege scalation vulnerability. There is one device driver
affected: "symTDI.sys". 

The flaw exists in incorrect validation of the outputBuffer VA for the
"83022323" IOCTL. Thus, an attacker without special privileges could
call DeviceIoControl with the handle to the affected driver's symbolic
link ("\\.\symTDI") and specify an arbitrary address withing ring0
which will be overwritten by the driver. 

We don't care wich value does the driver write to the output buffer. 
A generic exploit can be written (as the one attached to this advisory 
demonstrates). Any low value (less or equal to 7Fh) can be used to 
allocate memory and write our shellcode there. The method used to have 
our shellcode executed is the same used by Ruben Santamarta in some 
previous exploits for other Symantec drivers (patching 
NTQuerySystemInformation switch table). Sorry but I have no 
time to reinvent the wheel. 

The exploit has not been written to handle high values, but it is 
trivial to do that (overwritin for example MmUserProbeAddress), 
so we would have a fully generic exploit.

The exploit patches a hardcoded memory address which was valid in the
time of writing this exploit (originally for Windows XP). But since then,
Microsoft has patched the Windows kernel, so the hardcoded address should 
be changed to make the exploit work again.
